I have released a plugin that is a highly optimized version of Zsh-Syntax-Highlighting project. Overall
`60` optimizing commits have been shipped, and the result is that `zed`/`vared` can edit functions
that have `10 kB` of text in their body. Also, multiple syntax-recognition upgrades are being
shipped:

1. Variable highlighting
1. Colorizing of `${(a)parameter[...]}` inside strings (normally only `$parameter` is colorized)
1. Fixed colorizing of function definition, like `abc() { ... }` – `abc` will not be red
1. Fixed colorizing of complex conditions inside `[[`, like `[[ "$a" || "$b" ]]`
1. Closing `]]` and `]` are highlighted
1. Paths from `$CDPATH` aren't colorized unless the command is `cd`
