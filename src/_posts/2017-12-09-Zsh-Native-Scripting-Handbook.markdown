When writing Zsh plugins I learned (i.a. thanks to #zsh channel) how to avoid
forks to external tools, for speed and lack of dependencies. I've put this
experience into Asciidoc document. It captures essential differences between
Bash and Zsh and provides quick introduction to Zshell main features, like
extended-glob or in-substitution code execution. There are two versions
of the document (rendered differently):
