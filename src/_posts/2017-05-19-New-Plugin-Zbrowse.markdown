I have released a plugin that shows current user-defined shell variables in `Zsh` using full-screen
textual UI. When coding
a script, testing something in shell, etc. one often does repetitive `echo $var` to see result
of a loop, a function, etc. Now just pressing `Ctrl-B` suffices, a `ZUI` application will start
– the `zbrowse`, and nicely list all user-defined (not from e.g. `zshrc`) parameters (i.e.
variables). One can also show **all** shell parameters and search them incrementally.

The project is located at [Github](https://github.com/zdharma/zbrowse)
