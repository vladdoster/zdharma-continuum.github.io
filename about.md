A blog about development of Zshell projects. In **2016**, I did **3152** commits in total. That is **8.7** commits a
day. In **2017**, it was **2737** commits, it is **7.5** commits a day. Not excluding holidays. Check my Github profile
to obtain confirmation for those numbers: [https://github.com/psprint](https://github.com/psprint). All code was for
Zshell or indirectly associated with Zshell.

I have more ideas for projects and features, I hope I maintain the **~8** commits a day pace thanks to the donations.

Thanks for reading!
